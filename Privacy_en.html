        <h1><center>My Password Vault Privacy Policy</center></h1>
        <p><strong>Last Updated: June 13, 2025</strong></p>
        <p>My Password Vault ("Application") is developed by Bektaş GÜRSU ("Developer"). This Privacy Policy describes our policies and procedures on the collection, use, storage, and protection of your information when you use the Application.</p>
        
        <p>By using our Application, you agree to the data practices described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

        <h2>1. Information We Collect and How It's Stored</h2>
        <p>The Application stores the following information <b>locally on your device only</b> to perform its functions. This information is strictly not sent to the Developer or any third party.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Username:</b> The username you set during registration is used for the login screen and in backup file naming.</li>
            <li><b>Master Password Information:</b> Your master password itself is <u>never stored</u>. Instead, for login verification, a strongly hashed (using BCrypt algorithm) version of your master password and a unique salt value used for this hashing process are stored.</li>
            <li><b>Data Encryption Salt (DEK Salt):</b> A second unique salt specific to you is stored, which is used to derive your Data Encryption Key (DEK) from your master password.</li>
            <li><b>Your Password Entries:</b> Service names, usernames for these services, passwords, and notes that you choose to save in the Application. These passwords and notes are stored on your device encrypted with a strong encryption algorithm like AES-256, using the Data Encryption Key (DEK) derived from your master password.</li>
            <li><b>Biometric Setup Data (If Enabled):</b> To allow quick login via biometric authentication, an encrypted version of your Data Encryption Key (DEK) – protected by an Android Keystore key – along with technical data such as the IV (Initialization Vector) and your DEK salt, is stored in the application-specific SharedPreferences on your device. <b>The Application absolutely does not collect, store, or access your biometric data itself (such as fingerprints or face data).</b> The biometric authentication process is managed entirely and securely by the Android operating system.</li>
            <li><b>Application Settings:</b> Your in-app preferences, such as language choice, auto-lock duration, and clipboard clearing duration, are stored locally in SharedPreferences.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>The information stored locally on your device is used for the following purposes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>To allow you to securely log in to the application using your chosen username and master password (its hashed version).</li>
            <li>To securely store (encrypted) and display to you (decrypted) the service names, usernames, passwords, and notes you enter.</li>
            <li>To derive your Data Encryption Key (DEK) from your master password and DEK salt, and to use this key to encrypt/decrypt your data.</li>
            <li>If enabled, to use the Android Keystore key via biometric authentication to decrypt your encrypted DEK and start your session.</li>
            <li>To back up and restore your data at your request.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Data Storage and Security</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><b>All your data (user information, encrypted passwords, settings) is stored solely and exclusively within the local storage of your own device (in the application's private directory).</b></li>
            <li>Your data is protected with AES-256 (or similarly strong) encryption. The key used for this encryption (DEK) is derived from your master password using a strong key derivation function like PBKDF2 with a user-specific salt.</li>
            <li>You are solely responsible for the security and remembrance of your master password. <b>If you forget your master password, access to your encrypted data on your device will be permanently lost, and this data cannot be recovered by anyone, including the Developer.</b></li>
            <li>The Application utilizes the screen capture prevention feature (FLAG_SECURE) provided by the Android system.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Data Sharing</h2>
        <p>As your data does not leave your device, none of your personal or password data is <b>shared with the Developer, any server, or any third parties.</b> The core functions of the Application do not require an internet connection.</p>

        <h2>5. Backup and Restore</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The Application allows you to manually back up and restore your data.</li>
            <li><b>Backup:</b> The backup process is initiated by you. When creating a backup file, your current <b>master password</b> at that time is requested. All your data (including user information, your original DEK salt, your original login hash, and your password entries encrypted with your DEK) is written to a JSON file, and this JSON file is then encrypted using the master password you provide and a new salt specific to the backup file. The encrypted backup file is saved to a location of your choice on your device (via Storage Access Framework). The filename will consist of an application-specific prefix and a timestamp (e.g., PasswordSafeBackup_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.pmbak) and will not expose your username.</li>
            <li><b>Restore:</b> To restore a backup file, you must enter the <b>master password that was used when that specific backup was created.</b>
                <ul>
                <li><b>On a Fresh Install (From Login Screen):</b> If there are no users in the app, this method will create your user account and data from the backup. If a user with the username from the backup already exists on the device, this restore process will be halted, and you will be advised accordingly.</li>
                <li><b>To an Existing Account (From Settings):</b> If you use this method while logged in, the data from the backup file will overwrite your current account's passwords. The data will be made compatible with your current master password.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>6. Android Auto Backup</h2>
        <p>For your security, the application database (`PasswordManager.db` and related files) containing sensitive data and the SharedPreferences file containing your biometric settings (`BiometricPrefs_v1.xml`) are <b>excluded</b> from the Android operating system's Auto Backup feature (backup to Google Drive). This is specified in the `xml/backup_rules.xml` file. Whether your general application settings (`AppGeneralPrefs_v1.xml`) are backed up is also subject to these rules (currently, it is also excluded).</p>

        <h2>7. Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Your data is stored on your device as long as the application is installed and not deleted by you.</li>
            <li>Uninstalling the application from your device will remove all associated local data (database, SharedPreferences files) by the Android operating system.</li>
            <li>You can delete your password entries from within the application.</li>
            <li>If you change your master password, all your data is re-encrypted with your new key.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>8. Permissions Used</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Use Biometric Hardware (`USE_BIOMETRIC`):</b> If you choose to use the biometric login feature, the application uses this permission to access the Android Biometric system.</li>
            <li><b>CHECK_LICENSE:</b> Required to verify the application's license status via Google Play.</li>
            <li><b>INTERNET:</b> Required for license verification and for fetching account logos (favicons).</li>
            <li>The Application does not request any other unnecessary sensitive permissions (such as internet, location, contacts, etc.) for its core functionality.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>9. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>This Application is intended for a general audience and does not knowingly collect any personal information from children under the age of 13. If you become aware that a child under 13 has provided us with information, please contact us.</p>

        <h2>10. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. When we make any changes, we will make the new policy accessible within the application and change the "Last Updated" date. Your continued use of the Application after changes are posted means you accept the new policy.</p>

        <h2>11. Contact Information</h2>
        <p>If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy or our data practices, please contact us:</p>
